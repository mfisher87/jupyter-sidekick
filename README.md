# jupyterlab-acp

Jupyter-native access to coding agents over the
[Agent Client Protocol (ACP)](https://agentclientprotocol.com) — a per-chat,
single-agent experience in JupyterLab, with capability-driven model/mode
selectors and slash-command + skill support that comes straight from whatever
ACP agent ("harness") you bind a chat to.

[![CI](https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/jupyterlab-acp/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/jupyterlab-acp/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> **Status: early but working.** A functioning JupyterLab extension: open a chat
> in the sidebar (or as draggable main-area tabs), bind an agent, switch
> models/modes, run slash commands, approve tool calls, and watch it edit your
> open notebook live. Rough edges remain — see [Limitations](#limitations). The
> design rationale is in [`docs/design-decisions.md`](docs/design-decisions.md).

## Install

Requires JupyterLab ≥ 4.2 and at least one ACP agent on your `PATH` — e.g.
`claude-agent-acp` (Claude Code) or `opencode`. Not yet on PyPI, so install from
source (JupyterLab is needed at build time to compile the extension):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/jupyterlab-acp
cd jupyterlab-acp
pip install jupyterlab hatchling hatch-jupyter-builder editables   # build tooling (jlpm)
jlpm install && jlpm build
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation                    # hook reuses the built JS
jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .
```

## Use

```bash
jupyter lab
```

- Click the **chat icon** in the left sidebar for the docked assistant, or
  **New ACP Chat** in the launcher to open a chat as a main-area tab (open as
  many as you like; drag/split them however you want).
- Pick an agent, send a message. The **model / mode** selectors below the input
  reflect what the agent advertises; type **`/`** for its slash commands.
- When the agent wants to use a tool, an **approval card** appears — allow or
  reject. Approve a notebook edit and watch the open `.ipynb` update live.

## The idea

A chat is **bound to one ACP agent for its life** — Claude Code, OpenCode,
Gemini CLI, Codex, Goose, and so on. The toolbar then surfaces *only what that
agent advertises over ACP*: its available models, its session modes
(plan / accept-edits / …), its config options, and its slash commands. Nothing
is hard-coded per harness; the UI is driven by the protocol.

This separates two axes that are usually conflated in AI chat UIs:

- **Harness** — which agent runtime mediates tool use, file I/O, MCP, and
  sub-agents.
- **Model** — which LLM that harness is talking to.

…and it leaves a third axis — **persona**, the bundle of context you bring to a
conversation — to be expressed the way the open ecosystem already expresses it:
as a [Skill](https://agentskills.io) or an MCP server the harness loads, not as
a bespoke Jupyter object. The reasoning is in
[`docs/personas-as-skills.md`](docs/personas-as-skills.md).

## Why it's in Jupyter at all

Because the agent can edit the **notebook you have open, live.** The harness
writes the `.ipynb` on disk; JupyterLab's collaborative document layer
(`jupyter-server-documents`) detects the out-of-band change and reflects it into
your open notebook view within a second or so — no chat-specific machinery
required. That live-document loop is the thing a terminal next to Jupyter can't
give you, and it's the reason this is a JupyterLab extension rather than a
standalone app.

## How it's built

`jupyterlab-acp` is deliberately a thin, additive layer on open standards:

- **[`agent-client-protocol`](https://agentclientprotocol.com)** — the official
  ACP Python library (the same one every ACP client builds on). All agent
  communication goes through it.
- **[`@jupyter/chat`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-chat)** — the
  JupyterLab chat widget primitives.
- **`jupyter-server`** + its collaborative document layer — for the live
  notebook-editing loop above.

It does **not** depend on, fork, or vendor the `jupyter-ai` persona/router stack.
Its dependency graph is part of the argument: a Jupyter-native ACP experience
needs none of the persona abstraction. See
[`docs/design-decisions.md`](docs/design-decisions.md) (Fork 6) for the full
reasoning.

## Relationship to Project Jupyter and to Zed

This is an independent, community project — **not** an official Project Jupyter
package, and **not** affiliated with or endorsed by Zed Industries.

The per-chat single-agent model is **inspired by [Zed](https://zed.dev/acp)**,
which co-created ACP and pioneered this interaction design for external agents.
ACP is Zed's open protocol, released for exactly this kind of adoption; building
on it is how we honor that work. We're grateful for it.

## Reference implementation

A working proof-of-concept — the same idea built *inside* a fork of
`jupyterlab/jupyter-ai`, on top of the `jupyter-ai` stack — lives at
[`cboettig/jupyter-ai@acp-bridge-impl`](https://github.com/cboettig/jupyter-ai/tree/acp-bridge-impl/jupyter-ai-acp-bridge).
`jupyterlab-acp` is the ground-up redesign that sheds those dependencies; the PoC
remains a useful empirical reference for how each piece behaves.

## Context

This work is part of an ongoing conversation with the Jupyter AI team about how
personas, models, and agent harnesses should relate:
[`jupyterlab/jupyter-ai#1558`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyter-ai/issues/1558).

## Limitations

Early and honest about it:

- **Not on PyPI** yet — install from source (above).
- **One conversation per panel/tab** — no in-panel thread switcher yet (open
  multiple tabs instead).
- **Minimal rendering** — agent text + tool-approval cards are shown; rich
  tool-call/diff and reasoning rendering, and a config-options selector, are
  not built yet.
- **Auth** — REST routes are token-authenticated; the streaming websocket is
  not yet hardened. Run locally.

## Development

```bash
# Python env (uv or venv); install package + tooling
pip install jupyterlab
jlpm install && jlpm build        # dev build (tsc + labextension)
pip install -e ".[test]"
jupyter labextension develop --overwrite .

python -m pytest                  # 37 tests: ACP core, capabilities, binding,
                                  # handlers (real-server), serializer, permission
jlpm build:lib                    # typecheck the frontend
```

Layout: `jupyterlab_acp/` is the Python server extension (ACP session/binding +
REST/websocket handlers, on `agent-client-protocol`); `src/` is the TypeScript
labextension (React chat panel); `tests/` and `validation/` hold the suite and
the Step-0 notebook-reflection check.
